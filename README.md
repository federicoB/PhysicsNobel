# PhysicsNobel

PhysicsNobel is the website about special people who won the nobel prize in Physics.

**link to website below**

But it's more than that, it was born for my *Web Tecnologies* course at the University of Bologna, and as that has some specialities.

First of all it doesn't have a memory for all the data its shows! Everything is fetched from others website APIs and merged together to show a uniform presentation.
